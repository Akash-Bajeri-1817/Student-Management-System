    <p class="card-text " style="text-align:justify">In 2009... We had a dream... A strong desire to <b>'Develop Developers'</b>... Since then, this work has continued with great effort and dedication. The most important aspect of this is my students. The idea to breathe life into the dying education system came to me while reading Dr. Abdul Kalam’s book, <b>'Ignited Minds'</b>. This academy is a movement run by students, for students. Here, you will be given not only academic knowledge but also moral awareness towards society and family. Instead of relying on others, you will experience the joy of standing firmly on your own feet—I assure you of that.

<br><br>We are engaged in activities to present good understanding about the subjects <b>C, C++, Data Structure, Java (Core, Advance), Hibernate, Spring Boot and Microservices, Python, PHP, HTML, CSS, Java Script, SQL, PLSQL, Operating System, System Programming as well as BCS, BCA, BBA-CA and BE</b>. We keep our primary focus in cultivating ideology of knowledge based learning in all students around us, instead of curriculum based learning . We indulge our students in practical application based knowledge by coaching them build industry standard projects for their curriculum.

<br><br>Since 2009, we have been working sincerely, and from here on, this effort will continue forever.

<br><br>Thank You.</p>
